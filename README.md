  Created water that reflects and refracts the environment around it. The water ripples and looks like its moving. It has simple specular highlights from certain angles. The edges of the water blend with the sand so that there is a soft transition between the water and the terrain. There is also a Fresnel Effect applied to the water that makes the water reflect/refract more at certain angles.
    Also set up the initial structure of the code based on examples from Lucas's lab.
